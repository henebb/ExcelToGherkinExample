Excel to Gherking Scenario Outline Example
==========================================

...or Excel to SpecFlow. But Gherkin is the language used :-)

Anyway, an Excel Add-in to easily create a pretty layout from an Excel selection to a Scenario Outline example.

Just mark the selection you want to copy and push the button. It will add the example to the clipboard. Then you can paste the result into the scenario outline.
